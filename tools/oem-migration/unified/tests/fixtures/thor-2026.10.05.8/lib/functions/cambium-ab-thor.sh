# Cambium A/B module for the Thor family (IPQ8074). See cambium-ab.sh.
#
# The XV3-8 has two 96 MiB NAND firmware banks, rootfs (slot 0) at 0x0 and
# rootfs_1 (slot 1) at 0x6000000. Its stock U-Boot default is
# "aq_load_fw&&bootipq": the Aquantia PHY firmware must be loaded before any
# boot. The persistent FIT selects the bank through its configuration rather
# than U-Boot bootargs: config@hk02 appends ubi.mtd=rootfs (as the validated
# single-bank installs do) and config@hk02-bank1 appends ubi.mtd=rootfs_1.
